Java is a very popular language in the software world. It can be used to build a lot of different kind of programs, including desktop, mobile and web applications. If you've previously learned a language like Python, Ruby or Javascript, Java is going to feel really different in a number of ways — but nothing that you cannot learn!

In this module, you'll first see how to write and execute basic Java programs, and also learn about some important things such as how to use types and how to write tests using JUnit. You'll then build a more complex program (a CLI game) using object-oriented Java features.

## Learning objectives

In this module you will learn to:

* Use Java's basic syntax.
* Test-drive simple procedural programming problems using Java.
* Test-drive programs in Java using Object Oriented Programming.
* Explain the main differences between Java and languages like Python, Ruby or Javascript.

## Fizzbuzz and Bank

Learn the basics of the syntax and testing of Java by working through two projects:

1. [Fizzbuzz](fizzbuzz_and_bank/01_fizzbuzz.md)  
   Use Java to test-drive a Fizzbuzz program. In this you will learn the
   rudiments of the language, including how to run code, how to test code, how
   to use branching and looping logic, and how to call and return values.

2. [Bank](fizzbuzz_and_bank/02_bank.md)  
   Use Java to test-drive a bank application using Object Oriented Programming.
   You will learn how to test-drive an application using objects and methods
   that interact with each other, how to isolate your tests, and how to manage
   state.

## Challenges

Strengthen your skills in Java by test-driving a word-guessing game.

1. [Part 1](./main/01_challenge_game.md)
2. [Part 2](./main/02_challenge_word_chooser.md)
3. [Part 3](./main/03_challenge_player_guess.md)
4. [Part 4](./main/04_challenge_guessed_letters.md)
5. [Part 5](./main/05_challenge_game_over.md)
6. [Part 6](./main/06_challenge_view.md)
7. [Part 7](./main/07_challenge_multiplayer.md)
