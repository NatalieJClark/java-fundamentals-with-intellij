# Java Fundamentals (With IntelliJ)

_Coaching this? Read the coach guidance
[here.](https://github.com/makersacademy/slug/blob/main/materials/universe/language_intros/challenges/java_fundamentals_with_intellij/README.ed.md)_

Java is a very popular language in the software world. It can be used to build a lot of different kind of programs, including desktop, mobile and web applications. If you've previously learned a language like Python, Ruby or Javascript, Java is going to feel really different in a number of ways — but nothing that you cannot learn!

In this module, you'll first work through some introductory bites, each of which focuses on one thing, then you'll be challenged to bring everything together in an extended programming exercise.

Very few people will complete all of the materials and that's fine but if you have any concerns please reach out to your coach ASAP.

## Learning objectives

In this module you will learn to:

* Use Java's basic syntax.
* Test-drive simple programming problems using Java.
* Test-drive programs in Java using Object Oriented Programming.
* Explain the main differences between Java and languages like Python, Ruby or Javascript.


## IntelliJ Set Up

We will be using the [IntelliJ IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) from Jet Brains! 

Head to the [link](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=mac) and download the Community Edition - this is the edition that is free, but is more than capable of handling absolutely everything we need to be able to get going with our Java learning!

Once you have downloaded the `.dmg` file from the website you can drag it into your Applications folder and get started with the "Fizzbuzz" initial challenge.

## Phase 1

Learn about basic Java syntax, SpringBoot and JUnit.
