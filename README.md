# Java Fundamentals (With IntelliJ)

## Introduction

- This is my Java Fundamentals project for Makers SWE Specialism Module 1 - Learning Java & Its Tools
- This project is cloned from the Makers course repo, so it contains a lot of teaching materials.
- It contains lots of practise code for learning Java within `.bites/examples`

## Aims

- [x] Learn basic Java syntax
- [x] Learn the main differences between Java and languages like Python, Ruby or JavaScript.

If Statements (Leap Year) Challenge:
- [x] Create a class which will tell you whether a year is a leap year, according to the following rules:
    - [x] All years divisible by 400 ARE leap years (e.g. 2000 was a leap year)
    - [x] All years divisible by 100 but not by 400 are NOT leap years (e.g. 1700, 1800 and 1900 were not leap years)
    - [x] All years divisible by 4 and not by 100 ARE leap years (e.g. 2004, 2008 and 2012 were leap years)
    - [x] All years not divisible by 4 are NOT leap years (e.g. 2009, 2010 and 2011 were not leap years)
- [x] Example output:
```java
LeapYear.isLeapYear(2000); => true
LeapYear.isLeapYear(1970); => false
LeapYear.isLeapYear(1900); => false
LeapYear.isLeapYear(1988); => true
LeapYear.isLeapYear(1500); => false
```


## Setup
```java
// To run the main method of any individual Class
; java ./bites/examples/Class.java 
```
