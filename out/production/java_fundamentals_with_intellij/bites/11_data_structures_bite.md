Learn to use some of Java's data structures

## Introduction

In Python, you will have come across lists for storing simple collections of objects and dictionaries for storing key-value pairs. Java has a few different flavours of each but one thing is common to them all - typing!

For this section, create a class called `Sandbox` so that you can write some experimental code in the `main` method.

## Arrays

Let's start with some examples.

```java
String[] programmingLanguages = {"Java", "Python"};
Intger[] someGreatNumbers = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11};
```

There are a couple of interesting things here, which get revealed if you try to play with the code a bit. See what happens if you do this inside the `main` method of your `Sandbox` class...

```java
String[] contentsOfMyPocket = {"keys", "phone", 10}
```

    You'll probably have found that IntelliJ underlined the number 10 in red and, if you hover your cursor over the red line, suggested that you "Wrap using String.valueOf()".

    This is because Java arrays can only contain one type of thing and you just tried to create an array containing both Strings and an Integer.
